# Next.js 15 App Directory Dynamic Import Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with dynamic imports in Next.js 15's App directory.  The issue involves unexpected behavior when attempting to dynamically import a module within a component.  The provided example showcases the problem and a potential workaround.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a simple component that attempts to dynamically import a module.  Under certain conditions, this dynamic import might fail or produce unexpected results in the App directory, unlike its behavior in the Pages directory.  The specific manifestation of the bug may vary depending on the dynamic import and the deployment environment.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates a possible solution.  While not a guaranteed fix for all cases, it might resolve the issue by applying a specific approach to managing the dynamic import and the state it might update, like using suspense and error handling in the process. The exact solution will depend on the specific nature of the dynamic import and its usage within the component.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

Observe the behavior in the browser.  The solution example should provide a more stable and predictable output compared to the initial bug example.
